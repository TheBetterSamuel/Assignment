# Banana
## Design rational
This website is inspired by Apple. Using a simplistic black and white style website similar to Apple's website. I used san-serif fonts that are simple, similar to the stye of Apple, and ensure that the font size is easy to read but not too big. The company would be cakked Banana so as to not be a direct copy of Apple, but rather a company with similar products.

## Design Process
### Hompage
The original intent of the homepage was meant to showcase all the products, show the staff and provide info for the company. However, Having photos from the original website felt risky as it could be counted as plaigarism, so that idea was scraped.

It was planned to showcase the products with text and still images. However, I decided to add an image slider as not only would it make the website shorter, it also brings life into the website by being a moving element.

### Products Page
It was intended for the products to be presented in columns in a straight line. However, I felt that made the website look cramp and sloppy. As such, I decided to space out the products and present them in rowss instead. These products would be interchanging directions of text and position of the images, beinging some variety to the webpage.

Also, I intended to add in more products, such as Banana Tunes. However, I decided to simplify it down as I did not want the code to be too lengthy or complicated. This is because I had to balance this assignment along with other work that I had from other modules.

### Service and Support
This page was added later on as I realised that all companies must have a means of communicating with their customers. So a Service and Support was added for customers to send feedback back to the company.

## About the page
This Website has 6 pages. They are the Home Page, a page for each type of product, and a support page for any cocerns regarding the products. The products are the iFone, iTab, the Mak and any accessories that accompany the products.

## Features
These are the features avaliable on the website
* Each Product is shown with their renders, along with specifications and the avaliable pricing for each product
* Image slider showcasing the best models from each product line
* Info about the company for the customers to know them better
* Services and support for customers to connect with the company

## Target Audience
The audience would be supporters of this brand, and those who wish to try out the products. 

## Purpose of the wensite
This website serves as a catalogue for users to navigate and find their desired products, so as to either buy the product in store or via the online store. Not only would the supporters be able to see the newest products released, those who wish to experience the product can understand the products better as there are specifications given for each product.

Not only that, the website provides an outlet for the company to reach out to its customer. The Service and Support page gives a space and opportunity for customers to voice out concerns regarding their products, or any issues with a faulty product that they have bought. This allows not only the customers to get their issues resolved, it also serves as feedback for the company for further improvements on both the website and its products.

## Target audience's intent and purpose
The customer's intent is to find a product from the website that they desire. They would consider buying the product or look at other brands. Their purpose is to help maintain the business as it is a consumer=run business, and also to grow and interest in the company if they have never bought any of the products before.

## Testing
### Testing method
After each file is done, I test to ensure the website works normally. I check if the fonts are working, whether the fonts are too small or large, and test the sizing of the images to ensure they are the right size. I also ensure any interactive element of the page, such as inputs, textarea and buttons, to ensure the website is interactive. Lastly, I check to make sure the responsive element works on each website.

I also check each code file to ensure there are no typos in the code, or incorrect code such as wrong class or id names.
