# Assignment
This website is inspired by Apple. Using a simplistic black and white style website similar to Apple's website. I used san-serif fonts that are simple, similar to the stye of Apple, and ensure that the font size is easy to read but not too big. The company would be cakked Banana so as to not be a direct copy of Apple, but rather a company with similar products.

This Website has 6 pages. They are the Home Page, a page for each type of product, and a support page for any cocerns regarding the products. The products are the iFone, iTab, the Mak and any accessories that accompany the products.

The audience would be supporters of this brand, and those who wish to try out the products. This website serves as a catalogue for users to navigate and find their desired products, so as to either buy the product in store or via the online store.

The customer's intent is to find a product from the website that they desire. They would consider buying the product or look at other brands. Their purpose is to help maintain the business as it is a consumer=run business, and also to grow and interest in the company if they have never bought any of the products before.
